<h1>The Best Guns in Valorant</h1>

<h2>My top 5 best buys in the game.</h2>
<hr />



<h3>Frenzy</h3>
Amazing fire rate and easy to control spray from close-mid range. You would be surprised how many headshots I've gotten from long range with this gun.




<h3>Stinger</h3>
Same reasons as Frenzy but with higher damage.

<h3>Spectre</h3>
Personally I prefer Stringer over Spectre but I decided to include both due to the popularity of this gun, it is good, yes, I personally just don't like it that much.

<h3>Phantom</h3>
For days when I can't one tap. But seriously, it has a large ammo reserve, easy to control the spray. No bullet tracers. 

<h3>Vandal</h3>
For days when I can't spray.
