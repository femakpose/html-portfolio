<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am many things, I have many interests. I graduated University with First Class Honours in a Drama degree. I play 
  pc games almost everyday, I watch anime, I listen to kpop, I take dance classes, I take pole dance classes, I go to 
  the gym, I used to play piano, I built my own computer, I have over 200 movies and series saved on JUST my netflix 
  account (we won't even talk about what I have saved on Amazon, NOWTV, Disney+). What I'm trying to say is: I'm a 
  great multitasker with a lot of interests and a big enough brain to be able to cater towards all of my interests. 
</p>

<p>Most of my interests came from pure curiosity. I was a gamer but had a laptop and knew I needed a computer to play 
  those games at their full potential but I didn't want to waste money on a pre-built one so I decided to research pc 
  parts. When I realised I could actually just build a pc on my own then that's what I decided to do, so I did it. I 
  became curios about coding as I have many friends who are in the tech industry (many working as data analysts), and 
  coding seemed the most interesting. So, I purchased a couple courses off Udemy and got to coding. And now here I am, 
  making my website portfolio. Hopefully by now it will look much better than just Times New Roman on a white screen.
